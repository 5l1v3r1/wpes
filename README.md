WeakNet PHP Execution Shell

This is a simple PHP exec shell that I wish to expand upon. It is only text, no images, or pulled scripts, etc. Just one single file. I have added support for traversing directories that are listed by <code>ls</code> commands and even <code>cat</code> for files listed.<br />
<br />
Here is a screenshot of the interface with a simple ls command on an exploited server.
